				    <h3>Registration</h3>
				    Players will be required to register online prior to creating an Enel account. If a player has not previously created an account, the website will automatically prompt the player to do so. Once completed, players will be provided with options on how to credit their Enel Games Wallet. Once players have credited their wallets, they are able to access and play any game of their choice.

				    <h3>Crediting / Loading Wallet</h3>
				    <h5>Gaming Voucher</h5> 
				    Players can credit their ENEL Games Wallet by purchasing a ENEL Games recharge voucher. Players should scratch the back of the card to obtain a pin. The pin should then be inputted into the website as prompted.
				    <h5>Bank transfer</h5>
				    Players can credit their ENEL Games Wallet with funds from their bank accounts (via XXXX) using their debit cards. Once players have provided the relevant bank details and selected the amount they wish their Wallets to be credited by, they press ‘complete transaction’. Once the transaction has been authorized, the amount will be automatically reflected in their ENEL Games Wallet.
				    <h5>SMS</h5>
				    <P>Players can credit their ENEL Games Wallet by purchasing a ENEL Games recharge voucher. Players should scratch the back of the card to obtain a pin. Players should then text ‘xxx-message-xxx’ to the ENEL Games short code ‘xxxxx’.</P>

					<p>As an example, if the voucher pin was 123456789101, players would text the following on their phones to the ENEL Games short code ‘xxxx’: ‘Load.123456789101#’ and then press ‘send’.</p>
					<h5>Agent/3rd party retailer</h5>
					Players can credit their ENEL Games  Wallet through an ENEL Games  agent or 3rd party retailer. Players should provide the agent or 3rd party retailer with the cash amount they want to credit into their accounts and their phone numbers.  Once the agent or 3rd party retailer has completed the transaction, players will receive a SMS confirmation from ENEL Games  confirming the amount their wallet has been credited.

					The SMS receipt is confirmation that players’ account has been credited.  ENEL Games  therefore encourages all players to ensure that the text message from ENEL Games  is received prior to leaving the agent or 3rd party retailer.

					Alternatively, if for any reason the SMS confirmation was not received, players can call the ENEL Games  customer service number (+234 00 000 00) to confirm whether their accounts have been credited.

					<h3>Choosing a game</h3>
					<h5>Xtra Star</h5>
					<p>The size of the jackpot is directionally proportional to the proceeds collected under the draw. As a result, the jackpot will translate to millions and millions of Naira, which one lucky player can win!</p>
					<p>To win the jackpot, players must select 6 numbers out of 49 and match all 6 numbers with the 6 numbers drawn randomly by ENEL Games !</p>
					<p>There are major cash winnings for 3, 4 and 5 ball winners</p>
					<p>The more numbers you match the more you win</p>
					<p>There’s a second chance draw as well when there’s no jackpot winner, we give out major cash prices to a number of players who played the game for that particular draw</p>
					<p>The winners are randomly selected from all the participating players using the unique player ticket ID</p>
					<p>The Xtra Star draw will take place every xx-day-xx evening and will be shown live on television. Where there is no jackpot winner, the 2nd chance draw will take place automatically after the Xtra Star draw.</p>

					<h3>Purchasing a ticket</h3>

				  <h5>Qualification of 2nd Chance Draw</h5>
				  <p>Second chance draws are strictly available for the Xtra Star game.</p>
				  <p>In the event there is no jackpot winner, ENEL Games will run a 2nd chance lucky draw where multiple winners are randomly selected for cash prizes ranging from Thousands to Millions, depending on the size of the jackpot.  Players therefore have two chances of winning a cash prize: through the normal Xtra Star draw and the 2nd chance lucky draw!</p>
				  <p>The 2nd chance lucky draw will be based on players’ ticket ID numbers.  Each ticket bought by players will come with a different ID number.  Players that buy a ticket for Xtra Star are automatically entered into the ENEL Games 2nd chance lucky draw.</p>
				  <p>As winning the 2nd chance lucky draw is based on selecting a players’ ticket IDs, the chances of winning the 2nd chance lucky draw dramatically increase the more tickets players acquire!  ENEL Games therefore encourages all players to acquire as many tickets as possible so as to maximize their chances of winning the jackpot or the 2nd chance draw.</p>
				  <p>The Xtra Star draw will take place every xx-day-xx evening and will be shown live on television.  Where there is no jackpot winner, the 2nd chance draw will take place automatically after the Xtra Star draw.</p>
